# SERN Full Stack Application

This is a full-stack web application based on the SERN stack (Sequelize, Express, React, and Node.js). The application implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a backend built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, and a frontend built with React.


## Features

- Full CRUD operations on data (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Backend API using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM for database management.
- Frontend built with React to interact with the backend API.
- Containerized using Docker for easy deployment and development.
- Persistent data storage with a relational database managed by Sequelize (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL).

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios for API requests.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: Sequelize ORM (supports PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- **Containerization**: Docker.
